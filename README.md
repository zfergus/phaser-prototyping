These are game prototypes I created in the Phaser HTML5 game engine over the
course of a semester. Each prototype was designed and implemented in about
one to two weeks and tests an original gameplay mechanic and/or concept.
The prototypes, and Phaser, are both programmed in JavaScript, so they are
able to run in most modern web browsers.
